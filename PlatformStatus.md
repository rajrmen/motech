# Platform Status #

This is a placeholder page. I'm using it to gather status about the platform module. I'll eventually move this content to a google code page talking about the first (alpha) release of the platform.

For this table Beta means the module is usable and we do not expect the module to change drastically, Alpha means it is usable but most likely will change, In Dev means we are working on it and Planned means we have not started on it yet.
