# Overview #
For the April release, we will continue our focus on moving towards MOTECH Cloud, as we support our first MOTECH Cloud customers - World Vision and LAC (Grameen Foundation agriculture project). The Tasks module continues to be a centerpiece of our cloud offering, as we attempt to make MOTECH easy to configure for non-developers. Similarly, we continue to focus on developing UI panels for high-priority MOTECH modules in order to make configuration easy.

We have decided to hold off on making MOTECH truly multi-tenant for now we will host several sandboxed MOTECHs on each cloud server until we have a robust multi-tenant architecture in place later in 2013. We have a few cards earmarked for this release which will allow us to install and operate several instances of MOTECH on a server concurrently. We will migrate existing customers to the fully multi-tenant system with some managed downtime later in the year if required.
