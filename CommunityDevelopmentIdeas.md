  * **Nuntium integration** - Develop an SMS module that integrates with Nuntium (http://instedd.org/technologies/nuntium/). This will allow for more sophisticated SMS handling and routing than our existing SMS HTTP and SMS SMPP modules.
  * **Pill Reminder Admin Panel** - Design and develop administrative UI for the Pill Reminder module, which is used for adherence reminders for treatment regimens (e.g. TB medication, HIV/AIDS anti-retroviral therapy)
  * **MOTECH dashboard** - Design and develop a widget-based dashboard that provides an at-a-glance view of relevant statistics and reports on system usage for MOTECH administrative users.
  * **Integration with DHIS2** - Design and implement a module to integrate with DHIS2, a health management system in use by the governments of various countries in which we work.
  * **Sample UI/UX widgets in demo module** - We have a draft [document](https://docs.google.com/a/grameenfoundation.org/document/d/1KYsIfgLP162Az4DkSqy1ctVUq-NxOj6O_nsO9zU9d5Y/edit) describing MOTECH UI guidelines. It would be great to develop an interactive demo module that exemplifies these standards.
