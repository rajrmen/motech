# Introduction #

A key function of the MOTECH Suite(MST) is its ability to track clientâ€™s and their health information over time.  This process starts when a case is registered in MST.  For many applications, a case is the same as a client. E.g., an MST application to support pregnancies might include cases for pregnant women and cases for children.
The registration process can happen by mobile form on a phone, SMS, or through a call center. Registration is typically completed through a single registration form that captures the information needed to initiate care, such as the name and age of the client, or in the case of a maternal health application, information about previous pregnancies or risk factors for a complicated delivery.


# Use Cases #

## Registration by Mobile Form ##
A health worker using the handset application registers a case that is not yet enrolled in the MST system. This could occur if a CHW using the handset application is meeting a client for the first time. It could also happen if a client who is not yet in the system presents themselves at a clinic where the handset is in use.  In each case, the health worker using the mobile application would enter the registration data elements in the registration form one a time into the mobile handset.
## Registration by Web Form ##
MST can support registration of a case directly on the web. The process is similar to the Mobile Form registration except that the health worker (or other staff) would enter the data elements on a form in a web browser.  The web browser can display several fields at once.
## Registration by Call Center ##
MST can support registration of a case over the phone by a call center staff. The process could be initiated by an inbound and outbound call. The process is similar to the registration by Web Form, though a call center staff would be talking to a client over the phone as they register their case.
## Registration by SMS (Not currently implemented) ##
MST can register a client over SMS. The process could be initiated by an inbound and outbound call. The client would receive an SMS for each data element in the registration form. After replying with the answer, they would be sent another SMS requesting the next data element.  This would continue until all necessary data elements are captured.
